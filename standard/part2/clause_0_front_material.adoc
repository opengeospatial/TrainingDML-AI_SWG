[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI) Part 2: JSON Encoding Standard defines requirements for encoding AI training datasets as JSON. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is widely used for encoding data in Web-based applications. It consists of sets of objects described by name/value pairs. TrainingDML-AI Part 2 is based on the OGC Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI) Part 1: Conceptual Model Standard.
