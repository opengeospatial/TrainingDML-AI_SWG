DOTA-v1.5 uses the same images as DOTA-v1.0, but the extremely small instances (less than 10 pixels) are also annotated. Moreover, a new category "container crane" is added. It contains 403,318 instances in total. The number of images and dataset splits are the same as DOTA-v1.0. This version was released for the DOAI Challenge 2019 on Object Detection in Aerial Images in conjunction with IEEE CVPR 2019.

=== Non-EO Imagery TrainingDataset Encoding Examples

==== ERA5 Dataset

https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset&text=ERA5[The ERA5 dataset] is derived from in-situ observational data (Copernicus product), and we limit its usage scenario to the autoregression problem of time series data. Therefore, its label is the data itself. Similar to unsupervised learning, the autoregression task for time series data does not require additional labeled data. For this dataset, inheritance classes for AI_AbstractLabel are not defined, although this class is required in the existing standard (please note that these test cases are for future versions of the standard). In addition, additional attributes to support the complete representation of dataset information were added.

An example of XML encoding of the ERA5 dataset following the TrainingDML-AI UML model can be found in https://github.com/opengeospatial/TrainingDML-AI_SWG/blob/main/use-cases/examples/1.0/ERA5_hourly_data.xml.

==== SCIERC Dataset

https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/sciIE/[The SCIERC dataset] is derived from textual data, and its labels are the classification of the text. This dataset is a text classification problem, with the goal of information extraction and entity recognition. For this textual dataset, the Abstract class is inherited and AI_TextTrainingDataset, AI_TextTrainingData, AI_TextTask, and AI_EntityLabel respectively are defined. In addition, additional attributes to support the complete representation of dataset information were added.

An example of XML encoding of the SCIERC dataset following the TrainingDML-AI UML model can be found in https://github.com/opengeospatial/TrainingDML-AI_SWG/blob/main/use-cases/examples/1.0/SCIRec.xml.

==== nuScenes Dataset

https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes[The nuScenes dataset] is a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving developed by the team at Motional (formerly nuTonomy). The full dataset includes approximately 1.4M camera images, 390k LIDAR sweeps, 1.4M RADAR sweeps and 1.4M object bounding boxes in 40k keyframes. Although the training data may come from different domains, the 3D annotation boxes captured by numerous sensors in the same keyframe are targeted at the same object and are unique. Based on this, a 3D annotation box is used to organize each 3D object using AI_ObjectLabel. Since each training data and each 3D object require many additional attributes to be fully described, many additional attributes to provide a detailed description of the training dataset, training data, labels, etc. were added.
